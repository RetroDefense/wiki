With a suffocatingly large health bar combined with a 25% resistance to damage and a wide array of abilities to overwhelm your defenses, he is a menace on any map.<br><br><h3>Strategy:</h3><hr>Try not to focus all your defenses in the beginning of a map because if you do his Sword Strike ability will render them useless for a considerable amount of time,  furthermore, be wary of his ability to stun single units later down into the track and even to spawn more units to attempt to overwhelm your defenses. Because of his large health bar, pure focus on DPS is best to whittle him to zero health. Also any debuff effects which deal percentage based damage is extremely effective against him.<br><br><h3>Trivia:</h3><hr>Patient Zero is inspired by the enemy, ‘Patient Zero’ from the infamous, Wave 0000000 in Tower Battles. Patient Zero is also the slowest enemy currently in the game."
